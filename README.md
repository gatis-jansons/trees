Object Tree
===========

Deployed at [http://labas-programmas.rhcloud.com/](http://labas-programmas.rhcloud.com/)

Features jQuery for DOM, LocalStorage for persistence, TypeScript for object orientation, Webpack for dependency management.

* The code renders a tree of objects and allows to edit it.

* Two solutions are exercised: iterative and recursive. 

* I used TypeScript, because it helps with object orientation.

* The program is organised as a cooperative collection of objects.

* It is be possible to store/read the state in local storage. Use the "Save" / "Restore" buttons in each tree.
