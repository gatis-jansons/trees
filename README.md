Object Tree
===========

Deployed at [http://labas-programmas.rhcloud.com/](http://labas-programmas.rhcloud.com/)

* The code renders a tree of objects and allows to edit it.

* Two solutions are exercised : iterative and recursive. 

* A framework would be overkill for such a small task, I used jQuery library.

* I used TypeScript, because it helps with object orientation.

* The program is organised as a cooperative collection of objects.

* Use the icon buttons to add/edit/delete child objects anywhere in the tree.

* It is be possible to store the state in local storage. Use the "Save" button in each tree.

* It is be possible to read the state from local storage. Use the "Restore"button in each tree.
